# Arduponics

Arduponics is an open-source hydroponic garden automation. It was built above Arduino and using HC-05 as Bluetooth module to communicate.

**This repository is built in order to participate in Pesta Sains Nasional 2017**

## What is it?

Arduponics is used to monitor and keep water height inside hydroponic garden, monitor environment condition, and provide robust data access to many useful information about the hydroponic. Ardupoincs consist of:

* Arduino UNO R3
* HC-05 Bluetooth module
* Logic level shifter breakout
* Water level sensor
* DHT11 humidity & temperature sensor

## Where I can see it in action?

Come to Institut Pertanian Bogor! We'll be opening our stand on Pesta Sains Nasional on 18-19 November 2017!

## Further information

I'll update this repository soon after the event finished. If this repository has a positive feedback, I'll keep monitor and update to this repository.
